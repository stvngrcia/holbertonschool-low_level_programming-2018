# Synopsis

Learning about different search algorithms and their time complexity

+ All the files will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.

+ All the corresponding main files are located under the ```main_files``` directory
and have the same numerical prefix as the algorithm file. For example 0-main.c corresponds to 0-linear.c

+ All the prototypes are located in the ```search_algos.h```

|File Name         |Algorithm     |
|------------------|--------------|
|0-linear.c        | Linear Search|
