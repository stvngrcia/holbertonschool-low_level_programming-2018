# Synopsis

Learning about different search algorithms and their time complexity

+ All the files will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.

+ All the corresponding main files are located under the ```main_files``` directory
and have the same numerical prefix as the algorithm file. For example 0-main.c corresponds to 0-linear.c

+ All the prototypes are located in the ```search_algos.h```

|File Name          |Algorithm             |Time complexity|
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
|0-linear.c         |        Linear Search|          O(n)|
|1-binary.c         |         Binary Seach|     O(log(n))|
|100-jump.c         |          Jump Serach|    O(sqrt(n))|
|102-interpolation.c| Interpolation search|     O(log(n))|
