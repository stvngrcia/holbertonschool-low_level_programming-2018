## Synopsis
Learning about the Pre-processor

## Notes

+ The Pre-processor is not part of the compiler, but a step executed before the source code is compiled.

+ The role of the Pre-processor is to remove comments from the code.

+ It will include header file code in the file itself

+ If any macros are being used the Pre-processor will remove any macro name and substitude it for its value

+ The Pre-processor can replace tokens in the text, insert the contents of other files into the source file, or suppress compilation of part of the file by removing sections.
